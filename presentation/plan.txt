1 minute: Intro - what we chose / why
4 minutes: Algorithms
	- HMM representation for pitches
	- k-means for volume detection
3 minutes: Demo
	- Ode to Joy : get faster at end
	- Ode to Joy : get softer at end
	- Hamilton : just for fun
IF TIME: where we go from here?
	- learning for emission model ???
	- pitch detection ???
		- we'd need better sensors
