IDEAS

TOP 5
- Music learning. (I bet the computer can learn to play piano better than Brian can.)
	- RL. Form: binary form, ternary form.
	- A section has a theme in a specific key.
	- A'
	- Generate a canon.
		- take a chord progression and generate a melody? Or melody to chords? Both are okay.
	- Evaluate: look at harmonic sequences. Needs to make sense. I IV V I.
		- certain chords are "expected". Cadences. etc.
- To-do list prioritization. (No witty remark here. This is just a good idea.)
		- CSP (Constraints: wi-fi, dependency on other thing)
	- Or it could be an evaluation function. Takes in tasks, outputs an agenda. CSP?
- Email priorities. (Brian needs this.)
- When to do laundry. (How come everyone else also is doing the laundry at 9pm on a Friday???)
	- value vs. hour of week
	- lower value when busy
	- constraining clothing item
- Outfit chooser. (Brian's terrible at fashion and needs this badly.)
	- CSP. Constraints like "x color shirt can't be with y type of pants"
	- weather is a constraint.

BOTTOM 5
- Optimize a schedule. (Amy will find this very useful in her life.)
- Recommendations. (Brian could use some good music or restaurant recommendations.)
- Packing for traveling. (Because Amy's suitcases always end up top-heavy)
- When to text back. (Does five minutes sound too over-eager? Tomorrow's too late, right?  Emoji or no?)
- What pet to get. (I will name her Daphne. Or Carter.)
