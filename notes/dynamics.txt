note [time, pitch, vel]

X_t = where we are in the piece
	- pitch, and volume stored with it

Ea = pitch
Eb = volume

- Viterbi's Algorithm

- preprocessing of input step, filter out anything where the time interval is too narrow

- how to deal with long notes? Maybe just have pieces that don't have long notes. Or, encode with (slightly) lower probability of moving to next note in the piece?

- maybe break the Markov assumption a bit and say that the distance between past state and current one factors into our dynamics model

- Figure out the emissions model / transitions probabilities, and how we're going to figure that out?
